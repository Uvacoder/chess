**Note** \
<sub>I was bored one night, so decided to code Chess in React. It has been fun to write code for this complicated game. I don't have any concrete plans on what extent this project might grow, but I would like to try to create my own AI that can play against humans one day. That point is far though. For now, I am developing actual playable game with all rules of Chess. Status of completion of all features are mentioned above<sub>
